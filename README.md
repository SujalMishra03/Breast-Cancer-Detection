# Breast-Cancer-Detection
## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to classify breast cancer tumors as either Malignant (0) or Benign (1). The dataset used is the breast_cancer dataset from scikit-learn. The model is trained using scikit-learn and evaluates its accuracy on both training and test data.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which contains 30 numerical features extracted from breast cancer tumor measurements and a target label:
0 represents Malignant tumors.
1 represents Benign tumors.
